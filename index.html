Attention: Potential Security Threat

It has come to our attention that an employee may have inadvertently interacted with a scam link or email. While we are actively investigating the matter, it is essential for the security of our network and data that all employees who may have been affected undergo cybersecurity training immediately.

What you should do:

Do not interact further: If you suspect you've clicked on a scam link or opened a suspicious email, refrain from interacting with it any further.

Report immediately: Please report any suspicious emails, links, or messages to our IT department immediately. Your prompt action can help prevent further security breaches.

Undergo cybersecurity training: To mitigate future risks and ensure the security of our systems, all employees who may have been exposed are required to undergo cybersecurity training promptly.

We take the security of our network and data seriously, and your cooperation in this matter is crucial. Thank you for your attention to this issue.</p>
